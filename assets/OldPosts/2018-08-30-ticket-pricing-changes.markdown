We have good news for you! The planning committee has heard your feedback and we've lowered our ticket pricing. Here's a breakdown of the new pricing structure:

**Standard Ticket: $35**

**Conference Only/No Food Ticket: $20**

**After Party Ticket: No change**

Some of you have taken advantage of discount codes. Each discount code now discounts **$5 less** than it did before. For those of you without discount codes, follow us on Twitter [@PontiacTechCon](https://twitter.com/PontiacTechCon) and Facebook [PontiacTechConference](https://www.facebook.com/PontiacTechConference) to find them! If you'd like to retroactively apply a discount code please shoot us an email at vp@technug.org and we'll set you up.

What does this mean to those of you who currently hold tickets? We will be issuing partial refunds for the difference between your old ticket cost and the new one. We will be taking your discount codes into account as well (using the new discount amount).

Expect to receive refunds to the payment method you used during checkout within 1-2 business days as Eventbrite processes the refunds.

Reach out to vp@technug.org with any questions or concerns.

Thank you again for planning to join us at the first annual PonCon.
