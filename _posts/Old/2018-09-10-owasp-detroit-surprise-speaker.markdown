[OWASP Detroit](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Detroit) has been working with us to put on PonCon and they've surprised us today with a special guest speaker!

We would like to welcome **J Wolfgang Goerlich** to the roster of the first annual PonCon! Wolfgang brings a varied reportoire of experience when it comes to implement secure processes and practices within technical teams and organizations.

Visit out [speakers](http://poncon.us/speakers/) page for more info on Wolf!

Big thanks to Craig Mrozcka for planning to join us as a speaker on application security in the meantime. The OWASP Detroit team were scheming up this surprise for a while now, it seems!
