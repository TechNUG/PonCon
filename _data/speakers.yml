  surname: "Doler"
  company: ""
  title: "Psychology, philosophy, design, software. Not exhaustive. Speaker. Mental health advocate with lived experience. Not secretly a goat."
  bio: 'Arthur (or Art, take your pick) Doler is a software developer, data scientist, maker, mental health consumer, occasional writer (hopefully self-evidently), public speaker, and a human being (supposedly). He would describe himself as an autodidactic polymath, but only really smug and annoying people call themselves that, so he would instead say he has wide and varied interests. He is, on a wide scale of the entire human experience, generally okay.'
